# Coinbase
- The first transaction in a block must be a coinbase transaction

# Transactions
- Allow users to spend duffs
- The input of one transaction is the output of a previous transaction
- A transaction may have multiple outputs
  - Such as sending to multiple addresses
- UTXO: Unspent Transaction Output
  - For a payment to be valid, it must only use UTXOâ€™s as inputs. For obvious reasons
- Spent transaction output
  - The opposite of a UTXO. 
- If outputs exceed inputs, transaction will be rejected
- If inputs exceed outputs, the difference may be claimed as a transaction fee by the miner who created the block containing that transaction


## TXIDs (Transaction Identifiers)
- The hash of a signed transaction
- A sha256d hash of a transaction

## Outputs
- Contain two fields
  1) A value
    - Amount of Duffs to send
  2) A pubkey script
    - The conditions that must be passed in order for the duffs to be spent
- Outputs serve as inputs to subsequent transactions
- Outputs are tied to TXIDs

## Duffs
- One DASH is equal to 100,000,000 Duffs
